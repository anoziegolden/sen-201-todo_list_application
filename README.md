# To-Do List Application

## Project Overview
The To-Do List Application is a simple console-based program developed using Python.  
It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application.  
The project was developed following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is required to:
- Add a new task
- View all tasks
- Mark a task as completed
- Exit the application

Each task should contain:
- Task title
- Completion status

The system should be simple and easy to use.

---

### 2. System Design
- Tasks are stored in a list named tasks
- Each task is represented as a dictionary with:
  - title
  - completed
- The following functions are used:
  - add_task()
  - view_tasks()
  - mark_task_completed()
  - main()

The design names match the implementation names.

---

### 3. Implementation
The application was implemented using Python and saved as todo_list_application.py.  
A menu-driven interface allows user interaction.

---

### 4. Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding tasks
- Viewing tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Handling invalid task numbers
- Exiting the application

All tests were successful.

---

### 5. Deployment
The source code was uploaded to a public GitHub repository for submission and review.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Deleting tasks
- Saving tasks to a file or database
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)

---

## How to Run the Program
1. Install Python
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run:
